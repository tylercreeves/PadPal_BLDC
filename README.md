# A Note from the Creator
Great news hikers! I'm in the process of transitioning all of my projects/products I had sold/planned to sell on my website ([Rex-Creations.com](https://rex-creations.com/)) into open source projects for the UL cottage/hiking community to utalize. I'm starting here with the Pad-Pal, since it's the primary product I've sold these past 2 years and has the most users who could benafit from repair resources and part files being available. 
As I significantly pull back from making these for the community to focus on my career, my goals/reasoning for making this repository is that it can serve as a resource for:
*Anyone wanting one but cant obtain one from busy me can utalize this repo to make some for themself and their freinds
*Anyone with an older Pad-Pal can reference the materials and resources needed to get replacement parts made by service providers (read section BLANK)
  
If making your own seems like a hassel, you might be able to purchase one from my website where I plan to drop a few batches a year still. Just keep in mind that availability will be significantly limited, as I am in the process of transitioning Rex-Creations into a hobby business.

# Pad-Pal BLDC

> Author: Tyler Reeves, AKA T-Rex ([@tylercreeves](https://github.com/tylercreeves))

**A Brushless DC Version of the Pad-Pal ultralight electric sleeping pad inflator solution**

The Pad-Pal BLDC is the brushless motor version of the Pad-Pal. With the BLDC version, I take the Pad-Pal's origonal batteryless electric inflator idea and apply it to a more effiecient, more powerful, and longer lasting "brushless  motor driving technology.
